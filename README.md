This project was created for Stream 2 of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course.

Its goal was to expand my skillsets for creating a meaningful interactive data visualisation. I used a dataset from DonorsChoose.org to build a data visualisation that represents school donations broken down by different attributes over a timeline.

For the purpose of the website, I have assumed the identity of a graduate who benefited from DonorsChoose.org’s funding whilst at high school. I have created the website to promote the good work that DonorsChoose.org does, and as an interactive tool to allow people to look more closely at the projects supported. The visualisations show different attributes of the money raised and projects supported with users of the site being able to manipulate them to show information of interest.

To support users of the site there are written instructions providing a guide on how to manipulate the data.

Technologies used:
D3.js: A JavaScript based visualization engine, which render interactive charts and graphs based on the data. 
Dc.js: A JavaScript based wrapper library for D3.js, which makes plotting the charts a lot easier. 
Crossfilter.js: A JavaScript based data manipulation library that enables two way data binding. 
Queue.js: An asynchronous helper library for JavaScript. 
Mongo DB: NoSQL Database used to convert and present the data in JSON format. 
Flask: A Python based  micro – framework  used to serve the data from the server to the web based interface.
